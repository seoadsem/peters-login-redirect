Redirect users to different locations after logging in.

== Description ==

Define a set of redirect rules for specific users, users with specific roles, users with specific capabilities, and a blanket rule for all other users. This is all managed in Settings > Login redirects.

You can use the syntax **[variable]username[/variable]** in your URLs so that the system will build a dynamic URL upon each login, replacing that text with the user's username.

This plugin also includes a function `rul_register` that acts the same as the `wp_register` function you see in templates (typically producing the Register or Site Admin links in the sidebar), except that it will return the custom defined admin address. `rul_register` takes three parameters: the "before" code (by default "&lt;li&gt;"), the "after" code (by default "&lt;/li&gt;"), and whether to echo or return the result (default is `true` and thus echo).

* 2010-12-15  1.9.3: Made plugin translatable. (Thanks Anja!)
* 2010-08-20  1.9.2: Bug fix in code syntax.
* 2010-08-03  1.9.1: Bug fix for putting the username in the redirect URL.
* 2010-08-02  1.9.0: Added support for a separate redirect controller URL for compatibility with Gigya and similar plugins that bypass the regular WordPress login redirect mechanism. See the $rul_use_redirect_controller setting within this plugin.
* 2010-05-13  1.8.1: Added proper encoding of username in the redirect URL if the username has spaces.
* 2010-03-18  1.8.0: Added the ability to specify a username in the redirect URL for more dynamic URL generation.
