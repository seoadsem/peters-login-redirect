Redirect users to different locations after logging in.

== Description ==

Define a set of redirect rules for specific users, users with specific roles, users with specific capabilities, and a blanket rule for all other users. This is all managed in Settings > Login redirects. Version 1.5 and up of this plugin is compatible only with WordPress 2.6.2 and up.

This plugin also includes a function `rul_register` that acts the same as the `wp_register` function you see in templates (typically producing the Register or Site Admin links in the sidebar), except that it will return the custom defined admin address. `rul_register` takes three parameters: the "before" code (by default "<li>"), the "after" code (by default "</li>"), and whether to echo or return the result (default is `true` and thus echo).

== Installation ==

Unzip wplogin\_redirect.php to your WordPress plugins folder.

Redirect rules are configured in the Settings > Login redirects admin menu.
